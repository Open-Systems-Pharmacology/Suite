# Visual Studio Settings

* Use indentation of 3.
* Use spaces instead of tabs.
* If using Resharper, make sure a Resharper settings file is available to format your code.

# Naming Convention

Use meaningful and understandable names. Code should read as a story and only some well known abbreviations such as DTO, PK etc. should be used.

## Classes and Methods

* Use **Pascal Casing** for class name  `public class SomeClass`.
* Use **Pascal Casing** for public and protected method name  `public void SomeMethod()`.
* Use **Camel Casing** for private method name  ` private int somePrivateMethod()`.
* Prefix interface with I  `public interface IMyInterface`.
* Suffix exception classes with Exception `public class SBSuiteException: Exception`.

## Variables

* Prefix private/protected member variable with `_` (underscore): `private int _parentContainerId`.
* Use **ALL_CAPS Casing** for constant variables: `public const double DEFAULT_PERCENTILE = 0.5;`.
* Use **Camel Casing** for local variable names and method arguments: `int ingredientNode`.
* All members variable should be declared at one place of a class definition.
* Prefer variables initialization at the point of declaration .
* Do not use public members. Use properties instead.
* Do not use Hungarian notation (e.g. b for boolean, s for strings etc.).
* Except for program constants, never use global variables.

## Comments

* Do not comment the obvious
* Indent comment at the same level of indentation as the code you are documenting
* All comments must be written in English
* Do not generate comments automatically
* Do comment algorithm specifics. For example, why your loop starts at index 1 and not at 0.
* If a lot of comments are required to make a method easier to understand, break down the method in smaller methods
* Really, do not comment the obvious

# Coding Style

* No hard coded strings and magic number should be used. Declare a constant instead.
* Method with return values should not have side effects unless absolutely required.
* Exit early instead of having nested if statements.

  For example, instead of
  
  ```
  public void UpdateValue(bool isVisible, bool isEditable, double value)
  {
    if(isVisible)
    {
      if(isEditable)
      {
        _value = value;
      }
    }
  }
  ```  
  use
  
  ```
  public void UpdateValue(bool isVisible, bool isEditable, double value)
  {
    if(!isVisible || !isEditable)
      return;

    _value = value;
  }
  ```
* Do not write `if` statements in one line.
* Do not write `for` and `forEach` statements in one line.
* Always use block `{}` for `for` and `forEach` statements.
* Always have a default case for `switch` statement, potentially throwing an exception if the default is unreachable.
