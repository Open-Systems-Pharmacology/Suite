This open source Systems Pharmacology project makes formerly commercial software tools [PK-Sim®](http://www.open-systems-pharmacology.org/pk-sim) and [MoBi®](http://www.open-systems-pharmacology.org/mobi) available as freeware under the [GPLv2 License](LICENSE). All source code goes public. 

We invite everyone in the field of Systems Pharmacology, be it in academia, industry or regulatory bodies, to use the platform. Active participation of computer and modeling & simulation scientists in the further development of the modeling & simulation platform, the incorporated systems models, processes for their qualifaction and application etc. is encouraged and highly welcome! Please follow the community’s activities in this GitHub project.

# Open Systems Pharmacology Suite with PK-Sim® and MoBi® for Quantitative Systems Pharmacology

## Unmatched Flexibility - Unlimited Transparency
![platform concept](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1041237/22481683/1df757ea-e7c4-11e6-8599-76428a7398ac.png)

The Open Systems Pharmacology Suite contains different software tools and has been designed 
using a modular concept to allow efficient multi-scale modeling and simulation. 
The overall platform with its various software tools is implemented in a modular way 
as will be explained in more detail below. 
The central software tools PK-Sim® and MoBi® make use of building blocks as introduced here. 
While PK-Sim® is based on a whole-body concept, 
the focus of its counterpart, MoBi®, is at the molecular level. 
However, both tools extend to additional physiological scales as illustrated.
