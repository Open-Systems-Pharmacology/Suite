# Open Systems Pharmacology Suite with PK-Sim® and MoBi® for Quantitative Systems Pharmacology

## Unmatched Flexibility - Unlimited Transparency
![platform concept](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1041237/22481683/1df757ea-e7c4-11e6-8599-76428a7398ac.png)

The Open Systems Pharmacology Suite contains different software tools and has been designed 
using a modular concept to allow efficient multi-scale modeling and simulation. 
The overall platform with its various software tools is implemented in a modular way 
as will be explained in more detail below. 
The central software tools PK-Sim® and MoBi® make use of building blocks as introduced here. 
While PK-Sim® is based on a whole-body concept, 
the focus of its counterpart, MoBi®, is at the molecular level. 
However, both tools extend to additional physiological scales as illustrated.
